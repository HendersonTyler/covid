# COVID19 Live Tracker

I created this React app to practice context and hooks. It uses a [COVID19 API](https://covid19api.com/) to fetch results and displays the results with a [Flag API.](https://www.countryflags.io/)

I have found the API a little unreliable. So I have supplied a JSON file with results that can be swapped into the CountryState.js file.
